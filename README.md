## Usage
In our project, we leverage a variety of essential components and methodologies to ensure robustness, flexibility, and maintainability:

Jobs: These encapsulate tasks or processes within the system, allowing for asynchronous execution and separation of concerns.

Interfaces: Interfaces define contracts that classes must adhere to, promoting loose coupling and enabling polymorphic behavior.

Services: Services encapsulate business logic and functionality, promoting reusability and modularity within the system.

Design Patterns:

1) Model-View-Controller (MVC): This architectural pattern separates the application into three interconnected components, enhancing scalability and maintainability.
2) Decorator: The Decorator pattern allows for dynamic addition of responsibilities to objects, facilitating flexible behavior without subclassing.
3) Adapter: Adapters enable the integration of incompatible interfaces, allowing different components to work together seamlessly.
4) Rules: Rules encapsulate business logic and validation criteria, ensuring consistency and adherence to requirements across the application.
5) Traits: Traits provide reusable sets of methods that can be applied to classes, promoting code reuse and enhancing modularity.

## Contributing information
This project has been meticulously developed following the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture. DDD emphasizes structuring software around business domains, ensuring that the codebase reflects real-world business concepts and logic.

In addition to DDD, the project architecture incorporates elements of Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Definition Language (DDL). These architectural paradigms facilitate effective data management, control, and definition within the application.

For testing purposes, you can interact with the project using the provided endpoint: "localhost/api/documentation".

By adhering to these architectural principles, the project aims to achieve robustness, scalability, and maintainability, ensuring a solid foundation for future development and enhancements.
