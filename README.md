## Contributing information
This project has been meticulously developed following the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture. DDD emphasizes structuring software around business domains, ensuring that the codebase reflects real-world business concepts and logic.

In addition to DDD, the project architecture incorporates elements of Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Definition Language (DDL). These architectural paradigms facilitate effective data management, control, and definition within the application.

For testing purposes, you can interact with the project using the provided endpoint: "localhost/api/documentation".

By adhering to these architectural principles, the project aims to achieve robustness, scalability, and maintainability, ensuring a solid foundation for future development and enhancements.
